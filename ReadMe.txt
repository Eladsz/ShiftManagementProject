Employee Shift Management System (ESMS): A comprehensive Java-based application for efficient scheduling, time tracking, and workforce management. This system features role-based access control, adaptable functionality for employees, shift managers, and administrators, and supports essential operations such as shift check-in/out, employee assignment, and detailed reporting.

Features: The system supports the following features: initialization with administrator setup, user login, start and end shift registration, shift printing by day, week, or month, shift management (including assigning, searching, adding, updating, and deleting shifts), employee management (including searching, adding, updating, and deleting employees), and user logout. The menu dynamically adapts based on the user's role, providing access only to authorized functions.

Important to know: Upon system startup, an admin user is automatically generated with the default credentials (username: "admin", password: "admin"). Additionally, random user accounts are created and assigned shifts to ensure the system is populated and operational. Furthermore, at each startup, a log file is generated, capturing the date and time for tracking and auditing purposes.
